            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas, at the humble ſuit and requeſt of ſundry Our louing and</hi> well diſpoſed Subiects, intending to deduce a Colony, and to make a plantation in <hi>Virginia</hi> Wee, for the inlarging of Our Gouernment, increaſe of Nauigation and Trade, and eſpecially for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the ſauage and barbarous people of thoſe parts to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, did incorporate diuers Noblemen, Gentlemen and others, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers in the ſayd Plantation, and granted vnto them ſundry Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and Liberties; amongſt which, for their better helpe and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to raiſe ſome competent ſummes of money to proſecute the ſame Plantation to a happy end, Wee did grant them licence to ſet foorth, erect, and publiſh Lotteries, to continue for one yeere after the opening of the ſame, and further, during Our pleaſure; which liberty hath been by the ſame Company put in vſe diuers yeeres paſt. Now foraſmuch as We are giuen to vnderſtand, that although Wee in granting the ſayd Licence, had Our eye fixed vpon a religious and Princely end and deſigne, yet the ſayd Lotteries, hauing now for a long time been put in vſe, doe dayly decline to more and more inconuenience, to the hinderance of multitudes of Our Subiects.</p>
            <p>Wee whoſe care continually waiteth vpon the generall welfare of Our people, haue thought it expedient, for the generall good of Our Subiects, to ſuſpend the further execution of the ſaide Lotteries, vntill vpon further deliberation and aduiſement, We ſhall be more fully informed of the inconueniences and euils thereby ariſing, and may ordaine due remedy for the ſame, without any conceit of withdrawing Our fauour in any degree from the ſaid Company or plantation, and good worke by them intended.</p>
            <p>And therefore We doe heereby expreſly charge and command the ſayd Company and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and all their Officers, Miniſters, and Seruants, and all others, That from hencefoorth they deſiſt and forbeare, to vſe or execute any manner of grant or Licence from Vs for the keeping and continuing of any Lotterie, or to keepe or continue any Lotterie, within this Our Realme of England or the Dominions thereof, vntill ſuch time as Wee ſhall declare Our further pleaſure therein.
